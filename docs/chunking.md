# Chunking Strategies

Chunking is the process of dividing large files into smaller, manageable pieces for storage and deduplication. Quasar uses content-defined chunking to maximize deduplication efficiency while maintaining reasonable chunk sizes.

## Content-Defined Chunking (CDC)

### FastCDC Algorithm
Quasar implements FastCDC (Fast Content-Defined Chunking), which provides:
- **Better Deduplication**: Variable-size chunks adapt to content boundaries
- **Performance**: Faster than traditional CDC algorithms
- **Configurable Parameters**: Adjustable min/max chunk sizes and hash windows

### Key Advantages
- **Natural Boundaries**: Chunks align with logical data structures
- **Insertion Resilience**: Small insertions don't affect most chunks
- **Balanced Sizes**: Avoids extremely small or large chunks
- **Deterministic**: Same content always produces same chunks

## Chunking Parameters

### Size Configuration
- **Minimum Chunk Size**: Prevents excessive overhead from tiny chunks
- **Maximum Chunk Size**: Ensures reasonable transfer and processing times
- **Target Average Size**: Balances deduplication with operational efficiency
- **Normalization Factor**: Controls size distribution around the target

### Rolling Hash
- **Window Size**: Number of bytes in the rolling hash window
- **Hash Function**: Rabin fingerprinting or similar polynomial hash
- **Breakpoint Criteria**: Threshold values for chunk boundaries
- **Bias Correction**: Adjustments to maintain target chunk sizes

## ChunkRef Structure

Each chunk is referenced through a ChunkRef that contains:
- **Content Address**: Hash-based identifier for the chunk data
- **Size Information**: Uncompressed and compressed sizes
- **Offset Mapping**: Position within the original file
- **Compression Info**: Algorithm and parameters used

### Alignment Considerations
- **Block Boundaries**: Align chunks with storage block sizes when beneficial
- **Memory Pages**: Consider page alignment for efficient memory operations
- **Network Packets**: Optimize for network transfer characteristics
- **Cache Lines**: Align with CPU cache boundaries where possible

## Deduplication Benefits

### Storage Efficiency
- **Space Savings**: Eliminate duplicate chunks across all files
- **Incremental Backups**: Only store changed chunks between versions
- **Cross-File Deduplication**: Share chunks between different files
- **Temporal Deduplication**: Benefit from repeated content over time

### Transfer Optimization
- **Delta Sync**: Transfer only new or modified chunks
- **Parallel Downloads**: Fetch chunks concurrently from multiple sources
- **Caching**: Cache frequently accessed chunks locally
- **Bandwidth Reduction**: Significant savings for redundant content

## Chunking Strategies by Content Type

### Text Files
- **Line-Aware Chunking**: Prefer breaks at line boundaries
- **Language-Specific**: Consider syntax boundaries for source code
- **Encoding Sensitivity**: Handle different character encodings properly
- **Whitespace Handling**: Normalize or preserve whitespace as appropriate

### Binary Files
- **Structure-Aware**: Respect file format boundaries when possible
- **Entropy Analysis**: Adjust parameters based on data randomness
- **Compression Interaction**: Consider how chunking affects compression
- **Format-Specific**: Specialized handling for known binary formats

### Media Files
- **Frame Boundaries**: Align with video frame or audio sample boundaries
- **Metadata Separation**: Handle embedded metadata appropriately
- **Quality Considerations**: Balance chunk size with quality preservation
- **Streaming Optimization**: Support for streaming playback

## Performance Considerations

### CPU Usage
- **Hash Computation**: Rolling hash is computationally efficient
- **Memory Access**: Sequential access patterns for better cache performance
- **Vectorization**: Use SIMD instructions where available
- **Parallel Processing**: Chunk multiple files concurrently

### Memory Requirements
- **Buffer Management**: Efficient buffering for chunk processing
- **Hash State**: Minimal memory for rolling hash state
- **Chunk Assembly**: Temporary storage for reconstructing files
- **Cache Efficiency**: Design for good cache locality

### I/O Optimization
- **Read-Ahead**: Predictive reading for better throughput
- **Write Batching**: Group chunk writes for efficiency
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking I/O for better concurrency
- **Storage Layout**: Optimize chunk placement on storage media

## Quality Metrics

### Deduplication Ratio
- **Measurement**: Ratio of unique chunks to total chunks
- **Benchmarking**: Compare against different chunking strategies
- **Content Analysis**: Understand deduplication potential by content type
- **Temporal Tracking**: Monitor deduplication effectiveness over time

### Chunk Size Distribution
- **Statistics**: Mean, median, and distribution of chunk sizes
- **Outlier Detection**: Identify unusually large or small chunks
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust settings based on observed distributions
- **Workload Analysis**: Understand chunking behavior for different workloads

### Performance Metrics
- **Throughput**: Chunks processed per second
- **Latency**: Time to chunk individual files
- **Resource Usage**: CPU and memory consumption
- **Scalability**: Performance characteristics under load

## Advanced Features

### Adaptive Chunking
- **Content-Aware**: Adjust parameters based on content characteristics
- **Workload-Driven**: Optimize for specific usage patterns
- **Machine Learning**: Use ML to predict optimal chunk boundaries
- **Feedback Loops**: Continuously improve chunking decisions

### Hierarchical Chunking
- **Multi-Level**: Chunk large chunks for very large files
- **Tree Structure**: Organize chunks in hierarchical trees
- **Lazy Loading**: Load chunks on demand
- **Parallel Assembly**: Reconstruct files using parallel chunk retrieval
